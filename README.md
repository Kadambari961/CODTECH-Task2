OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Project: PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

Objective: The objective of this project is to perform Predictive modeling with linear regression 
Linear regression modelling aims is to fit a predictive model that reflects the linear relationship between a set of independent variables (X) to the output variable (y) of an observed data set of y and X values; Such that if an additional value of X is given without its accompanying value of y, the fitted model can be used to make a prediction of the value of y, based on the input X.

Key Activites:
1. Import Data Set: Importing the inbuild or by default dataset.
2. Independent Features and Dependent Features: For train and test data.
3. Standizing the dataset: Standizing the dataset using standardscaler.
4. Implementing Linear Regression
5. Predictions

Technologies Used

1. Python: The primary programming language for data analysis.
2. pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
3. matplotlib: Employed for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
4. seaborn: Utilized for naking statistical graphics that are informative and attractive.

Key insights:
1. Loading the default dataset.
2. Using independent and dependent features for train and test data.
3. Importing standardscaler for standizing the dataset.
4. Implementing linear regression and doing predictions.

Conclusion:
Thus in this CODTECH IT data analytics internship task 2 I learned to implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. Also learned how to split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data.Evaluated its performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared, and predictions on the test set. finally I have learned to visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.
Thus I studied to implement predictive modelling using linear regression.
